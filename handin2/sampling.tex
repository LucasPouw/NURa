\subsection{Sampling methods}

We use rejection sampling for Q1b and an equivalent of `np.random.choice` using the Knuth shuffle method for Q1c.
The rejection sampling is done iteratively. In each iteration, an array of random numbers is generated, which
allows for vectorized function evaluations. Because the number of generated samples is fixed for each iteration,
it is possible to overshoot the target number of accepted samples. These extra samples are thrown away.
