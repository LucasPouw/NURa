\subsection{Q1c}

We sample without replacement using a Knuth (or Fisher-Yates) shuffle. This is a method for
in-place shuffling of an array. If this array is an indexing array, we get random indeces with
equal probability with which we can randomly choose elements from an array.

Sorting is done with quicksort and then we make the CDF plot.

\noindent The code is at the end of the Q1b code, because it uses the samples generated there!
