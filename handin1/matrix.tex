\section{Matrix class}

All matrix computations and routines are made part of a \texttt{Matrix} class in \texttt{matrix.py}. This class
takes a 2D \texttt{np.ndarray} as input and keeps track of whether or not the matrix has been overwritten with
the LU-decomposition indices (through the flag \texttt{is\_LU}) and if any pivoting has been applied in the process
(through the \texttt{indexing\_array}).

The LU decomposition can be calculated with both the Crout's algorithm and its improved version, but the default is
the normal Crout's algorithm.

Matrix equations of the form $Ax=b$ can be solved with the matrix class by calling the method \texttt{solve\_matrix\_equation()}.
This assumes the \texttt{Matrix} object holds the matrix $A$, $b$ must be provided and the output is the solution vector $x$.
The solution can be iteratively improved if requested.
