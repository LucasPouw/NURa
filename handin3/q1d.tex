\subsection{Q1d}

The code and output are already shown in the previous subsections, but I'll discuss them here.

The number of degrees of freedom is given by $n - k$, where n is the number of bins and $k = 4$ is the number of constraints, which is given by the
number of free parameters (3) and the normalization of the histogram (1).

% chi2 uses the model mean as variance, which is very small in the outer empty bins. This therefore puts too much weight here and biases the model upwards.
